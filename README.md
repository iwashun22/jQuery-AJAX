# AJAX

This is the second topic I learn with jQuery, and [here](https://github.com/iwashun22/jQuery) is the previous lessons I had.

AJAX is Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It allows us to get or send data from the http server.

People commonly use `GET` and `POST` request method, but there's more.
In this tutorial, I am going to just explain the basics to note and memorize myself.
